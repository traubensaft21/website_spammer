This project of mine outlines a simple Python script. The concept of the given script is to
randomize and generate different login attempts. The basic idea of the script is to establish
certain amounts of fake credential data so that actors with malicious intent, who harvest information
through phishing sites, have problems distinguishing real victim data from the manufactured entries
of the script. This is a theoretical script of mine that is supposed to highlight a defensive
strategy to counter such phishing sites. It is a demonstration of how this kind of injection could
possibly help disorient stolen sets of data.
